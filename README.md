# Face-Detection-with-JavaScript-FaceDetector-API

This code snippet allows you to experience the newly added Chrome API (FaceDetector)

This API is still experimental and under development. It isnâ€™t available right off the bat in Chrome. From my experience some operating systems still donâ€™t detect very well (my Linux machine canâ€™t detect anything, my Windows machine only detects faces and my Apple machines detect face, eyes and mouth).
To put it available you must first enable Experimental Web Platform Features on your Chromeâ€™s flags. Very simple to do.

Go to : chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features

And enable the Experimental Web Platform features section.

After enabling it you should see a Relaunch Now button on the bottom of the screen.
